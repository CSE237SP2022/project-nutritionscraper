# project-nutritionscraper
### Daniel & Constance user story
- Accomplished tasks: Wrote the main web scraping functionality for the NutritionDataScraper class. This includes making the class set up a webdriver instance so that pages can be scraped upon object creation, the ability to read URL's from a text file, and outputting cleanly formatted nutrition data to the console. 
- Tasks for next time: Add the ability for the user to add which information they wish to be output (likely through direct input or text file), and add the csv output formatting. 

### Efimia & Gautami user story 
- Accomplished tasks: Created a bash script that compiles and runs the java program from the command line. I created a new branch in github from the command line to house this bash script while it is still in progress. 
- Tasks for the next iteration: Get the nurtition info currently printing out in consol to print into a text file that then is opened and acessed by the bash script. Help with JUnit testing for new functionalities.
