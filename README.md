# project-nutritionscraper
### Daniel user story
- Accomplished tasks: Wrote the main web scraping functionality for the NutritionDataScraper class. This includes making the class set up a webdriver instance so that pages can be scraped upon object creation, the ability to read URL's from a text file, and outputting cleanly formatted nutrition data to the console. 
- Tasks for next time: Add the ability for the user to add which information they wish to be output (likely through direct input or text file), and add the csv output formatting.
